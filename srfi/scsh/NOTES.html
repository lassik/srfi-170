<h1>Scsh implementation</h1>

<p>
There are two implementations of this SRFI, <a href="https://scsh.net/">Scsh</a> version 0.7,
<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">which can be found at GitHub in the scsh repository of scheme</a>,
and a Chibi Scheme <code>(srfi 170)</code> library.  You can find the Chibi Scheme example implementation,
and build notes for scsh, in their own <code>srfi</code> subdirectories.
</p>
<p>
This file documents the numerous exceptions and deviations
of scsh 0.7 considered as an implementation of this SRFI.
</p>

<h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Error handling</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
Scsh exposes <code>errno-error</code>
and uses specialized syntax to catch system errors.
</p>
</li>
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
Scsh does not distinguish between textual and binary ports,
so there are two procedures to convert file descriptors to ports,
<code>fdes->inport</code> and <code>fdes->outport</code>.
Textual and binary ports are the same, and there is no support
for buffering or for binary input/output ports.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File system</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The <code>create-directory</code>, <code>create-fifo</code>,
and <code>set-file-mode</code> procedures were changed in scsh 0.7 to take
a file-mode record instead of traditional permission bits.  A work-around
is to manually set the mode of a file, and use
<code>file-info</code> and <code>file-info:mode</code> to get a record
with the desired permission bits.
</p></li>
<li><p>
When scsh <code>create-hard-link</code> is asked to make a link across file systems,
rather than erroring it creates a copy of the file at <i>newname</i>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<code>access-time</code> and <code>mod-time</code> are rational numbers,
which are coerced to exact integers, and treated as the number of elapsed seconds
since the POSIX epoch of midnight January 1, 1970.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The <code><i>follow?</i></code> flag for scsh's <code>file-info</code> is optional.
</p></li>
<p><li>
The scsh <code>file-info mode</code> record field is masked to only return the nine low-order permission bits,
omitting the bits for <code>set-user-ID</code>, <code>set-group-ID</code>, and the save text
or "sticky" bit.
The scsh <code>file-info</code> record fields <code>atime</code>, <code>mtime</code>, and <code>ctime</code>
fields are exact integers instead of <code>time objects</code>, and are the number of elapsed seconds
(excluding leap seconds) since the POSIX epoch of midnight January 1, 1970.
It does not implement the <code>rdev</code>, <code>blksize</code>, and <code>blocks</code> fields.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Scsh does not have <code>make-directory-files-generator</code>, but it is easy to implement with
<code>open-directory</code>, <code>read-directory</code>, and <code>close-directory</code>.
See the Chibi Scheme implementation for an example.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The scsh <code>open-directory</code>, <code>read-directory</code>, and <code>close-directory</code>
procedures are called <code>open-directory-stream</code> etc.  The <code>read-directory-stream</code>
functions returns <code>#f</code> at the end of the directory instead of
an end of file object.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Scsh does not support the <code>real-path</code> procedure.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Scsh does not support parameters, so <code>temp-file-prefix</code> does not exist.
Instead, there is a fluid variable named <code>*temp-file-template*</code> whose
value is as defined in this SRFI with <code>/var</code> added in front of <code>/tmp</code>,
and <code>"~a"</code> appended to it, for example, <code>/var/tmp/6812~a</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
In scsh <code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> is implemented with
<code>temp-file-iterate</code>, with the following difference:
The scsh fluid variable <code>*temp-file-template*</code> described above
includes the substring "<code>~a</code>", which is required in the optional
<code><i>prefix</i></code> argument to <code>temp-file-iterate</code> (the
varying strings it iterates through are inserted there with <code>format</code>,
instead of being concatenated with <code><i>prefix</i></code> as in
<code>call-with-temporary-filename</code>).
If trying the &quot;To rename a file to a temporary name&quot; example,
beware of the cross file system <code>create-hard-link</code> bug
mentioned above.
</p></li>
</li></p>
</ul>


<h3>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Process state</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
In scsh the procedures <code>current-directory</code> and
<code>set-current-directory!</code> are called
<code>cwd</code> and <code>chdir</code> respectively.
</p></li>
</p></li>
<li><p>
Scsh specifies but does not implement <code>nice</code>.
</p></li>
</ul>





<h3>3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;Time</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
  Scsh does not provide <code>posix-time</code>, but it is easily defined using the procedures
  <code>time+ticks</code> and <code>ticks/sec</code>.  The first procedure returns two values, the Posix
  second and the subsecond time in ticks; the second procedure specifies how many ticks
  a second contains.  These are easily converted to seconds and nanoseconds
and from there to a SRFI 19 time object.
</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment variables</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
  Scsh's <code>set-environment-variable!</code> is named <code>setenv</code>, and does not signal an error in
  any way if it fails.  It does not implement any equivalent to <code>delete-environment-variable!</code>
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>12&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal device control</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
  Scsh's <code>terminal?</code> is named <code>tty?</code>.
</p></li>
</ul>
