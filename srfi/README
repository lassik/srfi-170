There are several ways you might use this Chibi Scheme example
implementation of SRFI 170.

You can read 170.stub and aux.c for a guide to translate to your own
FFI, the code above it should then work with little modification
besides whatever changes are made in calling down to C.

If starting from the SRFI 170 repository and adding to it a copy of
Chibi Scheme, copy 170.sld, 174.sld, and the 170 directory into
lib/srfi, merge Makefile with the top level one, lib-tests.scm with
the one in tests, and build and test as normal.

A full version can be found in https://github.com/hga/chibi-scheme,
forked from https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme, see branches
srfi-170 and srfi-170-new.  That'll get you the complete history.

The test suite 170/test.sld can be run as root, see comments at top.

The test suite is pretty generic and should be adaptable to your
implementation, note aux.c for some unexported magic like (errno) and
(set-errno), and common.scm for Scheme code shared by both.

As of initial release, it includes a very minimal implementation of
the pre-release timespec SRFI as a disjoint type in 174.sld.
