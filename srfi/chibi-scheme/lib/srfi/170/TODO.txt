Needed to match the SRFI:

Add optional buffer-mode argument to fdes->[textual|binary]-[input|output]-port

Finish call-with-temporary-filename


Needed for correctness, not production quality without this:

errno manipulation needs to be done at the C level, for Chibi Scheme
might set errno between any of 1) manually setting errno, 2) a POSIX
call possibly setting it, and 3) retrieving its value.  See the SRFI
199 discussion for more details:
https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-199/

The functionality of retry-if-EINTR in common.scm needs to be done at
the C level, for Chibi Scheme might set errno between the retry of the
POSIX call and retrieving its value.  See the SRFI 199 discussion for
more details: https://srfi-email.schemers.org/srfi-199/


Suggested enhancements:

Make appropriate procedures thread safe or thread aware

Improve temp-file-prefix specification and perhaps implementation

Use [...]at functions to handle long file paths.

See (chibi io) for how to write a C function then wrap it in a stub

WRT to above, in general, a great deal of cleanup can be done, this
project was my (hga's) reintrodution to using Scheme in anger after
many decades, and my introduction to Chibi Scheme and its extremely
nifty autogenerating FFI (170.stub) and raw FFI (aux.c).
