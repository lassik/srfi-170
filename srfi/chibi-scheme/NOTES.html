<h1>Chibi implementation</h1>

<p>
There are two implementations of this SRFI, <a href="https://scsh.net/">Scsh</a> version 0.7,
<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">which can be found at GitHub in the scsh repository of scheme</a>,
and a Chibi Scheme <code>(srfi 170)</code> library.  You can find the Chibi Scheme example implementation,
and build notes for scsh, in their own <code>srfi</code> subdirectories.
</p>
<p>
This file documents the current exceptions and deviations
of the Chibi Scheme implementation.
</p>
<p>
Note generally that the Chibi implementation is completely thread-naive.
What is more, the implementation's FDOs don't interoperate with
those used by Chibi natively, which may cause some issues mixing
SRFI 170 operations with native Chibi ones.  In particular, make sure to
hold on to any port on which <code>port-internal-fdo</code> was
called, so that the garbage collector does not close the file descriptor.
</p>

<h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Error handling</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The implementation gets and sets <code>errno</code>
at the Scheme level, and arbitrary code that might
change <code>errno</code> can run between the time a system or
library call sets its value due to an error and Scheme code gets
the current value.
</ul>

<h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The <code>fd->port</code> procedure
does not support either the <i>buffer-mode</i> argument or
the <code>binary-input/output</code> value of the <i>port-type</i> argument.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File system</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The implementation of <code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> is
neither finished or exported.
</li></p>
</ul>
