<h1>Chibi implementation</h1>

<p>
There are two implementations of this SRFI, <a href="https://scsh.net/">Scsh</a> version 0.7,
<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">which can be found at GitHub in the scsh repository of scheme</a>,
and a Chibi Scheme <code>(srfi 170)</code> library.  You can find the Chibi Scheme example implementation,
and build notes for scsh, in their own <code>srfi</code> subdirectories.
</p>
<p>
This file documents the current exceptions and deviations
of the Chibi Scheme implementation.
</p>
<p>
Note generally that the Chibi implementation is completely thread-naive.
</p>

<h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Error handling</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The implementation gets and sets <code>errno</code>
at the Scheme level, and arbitrary code that might
change <code>errno</code> can run between the time a system or
library call sets its value due to an error and Scheme code gets
the current value.
</ul>

<h3>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The <code>open-file</code> and <code>fd->port</code> procedures
do not support either the <i>buffer-mode</i> argument or
the <code>binary-input/output</code> value of the <i>port-type</i> argument.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File system</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
The implementation of <code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> is
neither finished or exported.
</li></p>
</ul>
