<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The host environment is the set of resources, such as the filesystem,
network and processes, that are managed by the operating system on top of
which a Scheme program is executing. This SRFI specifies some of the ways the host
environment can be accessed from within a Scheme program.  It does so by
leveraging widespread support for P<small>OSIX</small>, the Portable
Operating System Interface standardized by the IEEE.  Not all of the
functions of this SRFI are available on all operating systems.
</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The I/O and other environmental procedures provided by the various
Scheme standards were designed at a time when operating systems were far
more diverse than they are today, and therefore portability was difficult
or impossible to achieve.  In addition, Scheme has historically focused
on programming-language features rather than the practical needs of
mainstream software development.  Consequently, none of the standards
provide more than a limited set of operations.  Individual implementations
often provide much more, but in incompatible ways.</p>

<p>This SRFI uses the
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">IEEE 1003 P<small>OSIX</small>.1-2017 standard</a>
to provide maximally portable
access to the services of the operating system on which typical Scheme
implementations run.  Almost all operating systems today support all
or part of P<small>OSIX</small>, so the use of this SRFI is mostly
portable, but implementations are definitely not portable.  However,
an implementation of this SRFI can be layered over many existing
implementation-specific interfaces, or directly over a C FFI.  It is
even possible to implement it on top of the JVM and CLR virtual
machines.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI describes a specific P<small>OSIX</small> API for Scheme.
Rather than attempting to compromise between existing implementations,
the scsh system call specification was chosen as a base document.
Consequently, this SRFI is a reduced and heavily edited version of
<a href="https://scsh.net/docu/html/man-Z-H-4.html#node_chap_3">Chapter 3, "System Calls"</a>
of version 0.6.7 of the <i>Scsh Reference Manual</i>.
The numbered headers are aligned with those used in the Reference Manual.
</p>
<p>Scsh 0.6.7 was chosen for two main reasons.  It is fairly old, so most of its operations,
even those which were non-P<small>OSIX</small> at the time (2006) are now included in P<small>OSIX</small>, and it has
few or no operations that aren't P<small>OSIX</small> at all.  In addition, it is politically fairly neutral,
being tied to an obsolete version of Scheme 48,
an implementation which is not being actively developed.
Scsh 0.7 exists and runs on the current version of Scheme 48
(see Implementation section), but was
not used in designing this SRFI because it is incompletely documented.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI makes no effort to provide all 81 headers, 1191 interfaces, and 51
data types of full P<small>OSIX</small>.  Instead it provides access to a reasonable number of
highly portable interfaces (many of them even available on Windows)
with wrappers to make them more Scheme-like.
In particular, this SRFI excludes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most operations on file descriptors
  other than converting between them and Scheme ports.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to manipulate the file system based on
file descriptors rather than names, as with
<code>openat()</code>.
</p></li><li><p>
Everything to do with the creation and management of subprocesses and
communication with them.  The low-level P<small>OSIX</small> operations
are tricky to use, and a future SRFI will provide a higher-level interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Networking operations: see
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-106/srfi-106.html">SRFI 106</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Date and time operations, as the
P<small>OSIX</small> date and time operations are irregular and awkward.
This SRFI provides only the current time.
</p></li><li><p>
Access to command-line arguments and environment variables, as well
as provisions for exiting a process, as they are already provided by R<sup>7</sup>RS-small.
</p></li><li><p>
P<small>OSIX</small> file locking, which is notoriously
<a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/locking.html">broken as designed</a>.
Consider the use of dot files (or if necessary
non-portable facilities) instead.
</p></li><li><p>
All provisions for signal handling, as they are complex and require deep
integration with the particular Scheme implementation.
</p></li><li><p>
Memory-mapped I/O, locales, syslog, System V message
queues, and pseudo-TTYs, as they are considered specialized and out of scope.
Future SRFIs may provide interfaces for them.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The use of colons to join record names and fields into the name of a
record accessor is a convention of Scheme 48, on which scsh is built.
</p>

<p>Note: This SRFI is already very long, and adding detailed examples would
make it even longer.  However,
<a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-170/blob/master/srfi/chibi-scheme/lib/srfi/170/test.sld">the Chibi test suite</a>
is a good source of usage examples.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>Implementations of this SRFI on non-P<small>OSIX</small> systems, especially Windows,
must provide all the procedure names and syntax keywords.
However, if the specified action is not possible, the procedure should
either take no action and return some reasonable default value,
or signal an exception.
</p>
<p>A Scheme implementation that supports both this SRFI and multiple
threads of control must ensure that when a thread invokes a blocking
procedure such as an R[4567]RS I/O operation, only that thread is
blocked and not any other concurrently running ones.  Because
a user-visible thread may be multiplexed on a single P<small>OSIX</small>
thread, be in a 1:1 relationship with P<small>OSIX</small> threads,
or run on different P<small>OSIX</small> threads at different times
in its lifecycle, there can be no guarantees that a P<small>OSIX</small>
function which is MT-Safe (that is, thread-safe in the sense of
P<small>OSIX</small> threads) is safe for user-visible threads.
</p>

<p>
Several of this SRFI's procedures either accept or return a <i>time object</i>
that is fully compatible with the time objects of
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-19/srfi-19.html">
SRFI 19</a>.  It contains at least three values: the number of elapsed seconds
since a given epoch, the number of
elapsed nanoseconds since the beginning of the specified second,
and a symbol that represents the epoch and is the same as
the value of either <code>time-utc</code> or <code>time-monotonic</code>
as exported by SRFI 19.
The system clock is not required to report time at full nanosecond
resolution, nor is anything guaranteed about accuracy.
</p>

<h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Error handling</h3>
<p>
The C binding of P<small>OSIX</small> places an error number in the
global variable <code>errno</code> to report an error, along with
(in most cases) returning a sentinel value such as -1.
However, the procedures of this SRFI work differently.  Rather than
reporting errors as return values, they report errors by signaling
condition objects satisfying the predicate <code>posix-error?</code>
defined below.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI provides three procedures which will typically be shims
over whatever the implementation uses to report such errors:
</p>

<div><code>(posix-error? <i>obj</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i>boolean</i>
<blockquote>
This procedure returns <code>#t</code> if <code>obj</code> is
a condition object that describes a P<small>OSIX</small> error,
and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
</blockquote>
<div><code>(posix-error-name <i>posix-error</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i>symbol</i>
<blockquote>
<p>This procedure returns a symbol that is the name associated
with the value of <code>errno</code> when
the P<small>OSIX</small> function reported an error.
This can be used to provide programmatic recovery
when a P<small>OSIX</small> function can return
more than one value of <code>errno</code>.</p>
<p>Because the <code>errno</code> codes are not standardized across
different P<small>OSIX</small> systems, but the associated names
(bound by a <code>#define</code> in the file
<code>/usr/include/errno.h</code>) are the same for the most part,
this function returns the name rather than the code.</p>
<p>For example, <code>ENOENT</code> (a reference was made to a file or a directory
that does not exist) almost always corresponds to an <code>errno</code>
value of 2.
But although <code>ETIMEDOUT</code> (meaning that a TCP connection
has been unresponsive for too long) is standardized by P<small>OSIX</small>,
it has a <code>errno</code> value of 110 on Linux, 60 on FreeBSD, and 116 on Cygwin.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><code>(posix-error-message <i>posix-error</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i>string</i>
<blockquote>
This procedure returns a string that is an error message reflecting
the value of <code>errno</code> when
the P<small>OSIX</small> function reported an error.
This string may be, or may include, the output of the
<code>strerror()</code> function,
and is useful for reporting the cause of the error to the user.
It may or may not be localized.
</blockquote>
<p>
This SRFI also recommends (but does not require)
that the following additional information be
retrievable by other means:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the value of <code>errno</code> (an exact integer)</li>
<li>the name of the Scheme procedure (a symbol) that raised the error</li>
<li>the name of the P<small>OSIX</small> C function (a symbol)
that set <code>errno</code></li>
<li>a list of the Scheme procedure's arguments</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="node_sec_3.2">3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Dealing with P<small>OSIX</small> file descriptors in a Scheme environment is difficult.
In P<small>OSIX</small>, open files are part of the process environment, and are referenced
by small exact integers called <i>file descriptors</i>. Open file descriptors are
the fundamental way I/O redirections are passed to subprocesses and executed
programs, since file descriptors are preserved across <code>fork</code> and
<code>exec</code> operations.</p>
<p>
Scheme, on the other hand, uses ports for specifying I/O sources and sinks.
Ports are garbage-collected Scheme objects, not integers.
When a port is garbage collected, it is effectively closed,
but whether the underlying file descriptor is closed is left as an
implementation detail.  Because file
descriptors are just integers, it's impossible to garbage collect them.</p>
<p>
Ideally, a Scheme program could only use ports and not
file descriptors.  But code written in any language, including Scheme,
needs to descend to the file descriptor level in at least two circumstances:
when interfacing to foreign code, and
when interfacing to a subprocess.
</p><p>
This causes a problem. Suppose we have a Scheme port constructed
on top of file descriptor 3. We intend to execute a successor program that
will expect this file descriptor. If we drop references to the port,
the garbage collector may prematurely close file 3 before 
the successor program starts.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there is no even vaguely portable solution to the general problem.
Scsh and Guile undertake heroic measures to
open new file descriptors for ports when the old file descriptors are
repurposed for something else, and to track when closing a port implies
closing its file descriptor or not.
But doing so involves more
changes than an implementation should have to make in order
to provide this SRFI.</p>

<p>Consequently, this SRFI assumes that file descriptors will only
be used at the edges of the program, and that most I/O operations will be
performed on ports.
As an exception, <code>open-file</code> is provided, because
it allows arguments that the Scheme standard does not.  It returns
a port of a specified type.

The textual ports use the same character encoding applied
by default in the underlying implementation.
The symbol <code>binary-input/output</code> represents a binary port
that allows both input and output operations, as discussed in
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-181/srfi-181.html">SRFI 181</a>.

</blockquote>
<div><code>(open-file <i>fname port-type flags [permission-bits [buffer-mode] ]</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i>port</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>open()</code></div>

<p>It is an error unless exactly one of the <code>open/read</code>, <code>open/write</code>, or
<code>open/read+write</code> flags is provided.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><code>(fd->port <i>fd port-type</i> [<i>buffer-mode</i>])</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i>port</i>
<blockquote>
<p>This procedure wraps a newly created port around
the specified file descriptor, effectively importing it into the
Scheme world.
The most common use of this procedure is for a file descriptor other
than 0, 1, 2 (standard input, standard output, standard error)
that is already open when the Scheme program starts.
It is an error if a port already exists that encapsulates <i>fd</i>.

<h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File system</h3>

computer's file system.
<p>

<div><code>(create-symlink <i>old-fname new-fname</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>undefined</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>symlink()</code></div>

<blockquote><p>
These procedures create objects of various kinds in the file system.

<p>

default to <code>#o775</code>, and for <code>create-fifo</code>
to <code>#o664</code>, but are masked by the current umask.
<p>
</p></blockquote>

<div><code>(read-symlink <i>fname</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>string</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>readlink()</code></div>
<blockquote>Return the filename referenced by the symlink <i>fname</i>.
</blockquote>
<div><code>(rename-file <i>old-fname new-fname</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>undefined</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>rename()</code></div>
<blockquote>If you override an existing object, then <i>old-fname</i>
and <i>new-fname</i> must type-match &mdash; either both directories,
or both non-directories.
This is required by the semantics of P<small>OSIX</small> <code>rename()</code>.<p>
Calling <code>rename-file</code> on a symbolic link will rename the symbolic link,
not the file it refers to.
</p>
<blockquote><i>Remark: </i>
There is an unfortunate atomicity problem with the <code>rename-file</code>
procedure: if you create file <code>new-fname</code> sometime between
<code>rename-file</code>'s existence check and the actual rename operation,
your file will be clobbered with <code>old-fname</code>. There is no way to
prevent this problem; at least it is highly unlikely to occur in practice.

<div><code>(delete-directory <i>fname</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>undefined</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>rmdir()</code></div>

file specified by supplying the filename.
If the uid argument is the constant <code>owner/unchanged</code>,
the owner is not changed;
if the gid argument is the constant <code>group/unchanged</code>,
the group is not changed.
Setting file ownership usually requires root privileges.
This procedure follows symlinks and changes the files to which they refer.

<div><code>(set-file-times <i>fname [access-time-object modify-time-object]</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>undefined</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>utimensat()</code></div>

This procedure sets the access and modified times for the file
<i>fname</i> to the supplied time object values.  It is an error
if they are not of type <code>time-utc</code>.
If neither time argument is supplied, they are both taken to be
the current time.
The constants <code>time/now</code> and <code>time/unchanged</code>
are bound to values used to specify the current time and an unchanged
time respectively.
It is an error if exactly one time is provided.
This procedure
will follow symlinks and set the times of the file to which it refers.
If the procedure completes successfully, the file's time of last
status-change (<code>ctime</code>) is set to the current time.

Although P<small>OSIX</small> does not standardize bit positions in the

#o140000   socket file
#o120000   symbolic link file
#o100000   regular file
#o60000    block device file

#o1000     sticky directory (restrictions on deletion)
#o400      user read permission

<p>Note that to distinguish between file types it is necessary to
examine several bits.</p>

These procedures are file-type predicates that test the
file type stored in <i>file-info</i>.
<p>
This SRFI does not provide a special means for checking the
permission bits in a <code>file-info</code> record,
though they are available in <code>file-info:mode</code>.
There are several problems with such procedures.
First, there's an
atomicity issue. In between checking permissions for a file and then trying
an operation on the file, another process could change the permissions,
so a return value from these functions guarantees nothing. Second,
P<small>OSIX</small> special-cases permission checking when the uid is 0 (<code>root</code>)
&mdash; if the file exists, root is assumed to have the requested permission.

if <code>TMPDIR</code> is set and to
<code>"/tmp/<i>pid</i>"</code> otherwise, where <i>pid</i> is the id of the current process.
On Windows, the temporary directory's name is not fixed, and must be obtained by the
<code>GetTempPath()</code> API function.
</blockquote>
<div><code>(create-temp-file <i>[prefix]</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>string</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>Creates a new temporary file and returns its name.
The optional argument specifies the filename prefix to use, and defaults
to the result of invoking <code>temp-file-prefix</code>.
The procedure generates a sequence of filenames that have <i>prefix</i> as
a common prefix, looking for a filename that doesn't already exist in the
file system. When it finds one, it creates it with permission <code>#o600</code>
and returns the filename. (The file permission can be changed to a more
permissive permission with <code>set-file-mode</code> after being created.)<p>
This file is guaranteed to be brand new. No other process will have it
open. This procedure does not simply return a filename that is very
likely to be unused. It returns a filename that definitely did not exist
at the moment <code>create-temp-file</code> created it.</p>
<p>
It is not necessary for the process's pid to be a part of the filename
for the uniqueness guarantees to hold. The pid component of the default
prefix simply serves to scatter the name searches into sparse regions, so
that collisions are less likely to occur. This speeds things up, but does
not affect correctness.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<div><code>(call-with-temporary-filename <i>maker [prefix]</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>object</i><sup>+</sup></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<blockquote>
This procedure can be used to perform certain atomic transactions on
the file system involving filenames. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>Linking a file to a fresh backup temp name.
</li><li>Creating and opening an unused, secure temp file.
</li><li>Creating an unused temporary directory.
</li></ul><p></p>
<p>
This procedure uses <i>prefix</i> to generate a series of trial
filenames.  <i>Prefix</i> is a string, and
defaults to the value of invoking <code>temp-file-prefix</code>.
File names are generated by
concatenating <i>prefix</i>
with a varying string.<p>
The <i>maker</i> procedure is called serially on each filename
generated.  It must return at least one value; it may return multiple
values. If the first return value is <code>#f</code> or if <i>maker</i> signals an
exception indicating that the file exists,
<code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> will loop,
generating a new filename and calling <i>maker</i> again. If the first
return value is true, the loop is terminated, returning whatever value(s)
<i>maker</i> returned.</p>
<p>
After a number of unsuccessful trials, <code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> may give up,
in which case an exception is signaled or propagated.
<p>
To rename a file to a temporary name:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
(call-with-temporary-filename
  (lambda (backup)
    (create-hard-link old-file backup)
    backup)
  ".temp.") ; Keep link in current working directory
(delete-file old-file)
</pre></blockquote>
Recall that this SRFI reports procedure failure by signaling an error.
This is critical for this example &mdash; the programmer can assume that if the
<code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> call returns, it returns successfully.
So the following <code>delete-file</code> call can be reliably invoked,
safe in the knowledge that the backup link has definitely been established.<p>
To create a unique temporary directory:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
(call-with-temporary-filename
  (lambda (dir)
    (create-directory dir)
    dir)
  "/tmp/tempdir.")
</pre></blockquote>

Similar operations can be used to generate unique fifos,
or to return values other than the new filename (for example, an open port).

<h3>3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment variables</h3>
<p>R<sup>7</sup>RS provides two procedures , originally from
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-98/srfi-98.html">SRFI 98</a>,
to get access to environment variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(get-environment-variables)</code></li>
<li><code>(get-environment-variable <i>name</i>)</code></li>
</ul>
<p> Setters have not yet been standardized, so this SRFI provides them.
The main reason to set environment variables is that some C libraries
depend on their values: for example, localization depends on <code>LANG</code>.
If a program needs to change to a different locale, the most reliable way
is to set the <code>LANG</code> variable to a new value.
</p>

<div><code>(set-environment-variable! <i>name</i> <i>value</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i>undefined</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>setenv</code></div>
<blockquote>
Change the value of the environment variable <i>name</i> to
be <i>value</i>. Both <i>name</i> and <i>value</i> are strings.
If <i>name</i> is not defined at the time of call, a new variable is
added; if <i>name</i> is defined, its old value is discarded and
replaced by <i>value</i>. If <i>name</i> or <i>value</i> are invalid
according to the operating system, an exception is signaled.
Mutating <i>name</i> or <i>value</i> after the call must not change
the name or value of the environment variable.
</blockquote>

<div><code>(delete-environment-variable! <i>name</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i>undefined</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>unsetenv</code></div>
<blockquote>
Remove the environment variable <i>name</i> such that a
subsequent <code>(get-environment-variable <i>name</i>)</code> would
return <code>#f</code>. If the variable cannot be removed, an
exception is signaled. If <i>name</i> does not currently have a value,
the call silently succeeds.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Concurrency note:</b> Under most operating systems, environment
variables are per-process, not per-thread. Multi-threaded
implementations should guard against race conditions.</p>

<p><b>Naming note:</b> Many Scheme implementations (including scsh)
use the short procedure names <code>getenv</code>
and <code>setenv</code> (or minor variations). Since the long
name <code>get-environment-variable</code> has been canonized by
R<sup>7</sup>RS and SRFI 98, this SRFI follows that pattern instead.
Since environment variables are OS variables rather than Scheme variables,
it's debatable whether procedures to modify them should bear
the <code>!</code> suffix. MIT Scheme has the suffixed names and we
are not aware of any Scheme implementation with the unsuffixed names,
so the suffix is kept in this SRFI.</p>

<h3 id="node_sec_3.12">3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;Terminal device control</h3>

<p>
</p>
<div><code>(terminal? <i>port</i>)</code> &nbsp;&rarr; <i><i>boolean</i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>isatty()</code></div>
<blockquote>
Returns true if the argument is a file descriptor that is open on a terminal.
Raises an exception if the underlying call to <code>isatty()</code> returns an error
other than <code>ENOTTY</code>.
This procedure is useful when writing programs that change their behavior
when their standard input or output is a terminal.
Because it is expected to be called before doing input or output
on the terminal, it accepts a port rather than an file descriptor object.
</blockquote>
<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
There are two implementations of this SRFI, <a href="https://scsh.net/">Scsh</a> version 0.7,
<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">which can be found at GitHub in the scsh repository of scheme</a>,
and a Chibi Scheme <code>(srfi 170)</code> library.  You can find the Chibi Scheme example implementation,
and build notes for scsh, in their own <code>srfi</code> subdirectories.
</p>
<p>
Notes on the exceptions and deviations between this SRFI and
the Chibi implementation can be found in those subdirectories, at
<a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-170/blob/master/srfi/scsh/NOTES.html">
<code>srfi/chibi-scheme/NOTES.html</code></a>,
