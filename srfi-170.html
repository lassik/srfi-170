<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
The host environment is the set of resources, such as the filesystem,
network and processes, that are managed by the operating system on top of
which a Scheme program is executing. This SRFI specifies some of the ways the host
environment can be accessed from within a Scheme program.  It does so by
leveraging widespread support for P<small>OSIX</small>, the Portable
Operating System Interface standardized by the IEEE.  Not all of the
functions of this SRFI are available on all operating systems.
</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>None at present.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>The I/O and other environmental procedures provided by the various
Scheme standards were designed at a time when operating systems were far
more diverse than they are today, and therefore portability was difficult
or impossible to achieve.  In addition, Scheme has historically focused
on programming-language features rather than the practical needs of
mainstream software development.  Consequently, none of the standards
provide more than a limited set of operations.  Individual implementations
often provide much more, but in incompatible ways.</p>

<p>This SRFI uses the IEEE 1003 P<small>OSIX</small>.1-2017 standard
to provide maximally portable
access to the services of the operating system on which typical Scheme
implementations run.  Almost all operating systems today support all
or part of P<small>OSIX</small>, so the use of this SRFI is mostly
portable, but implementations are definitely not portable.  However,
an implementation of this SRFI can be layered over many existing
implementation-specific interfaces, or directly over a C FFI.  It is
even possible to implement it on top of the JVM and CLR virtual
machines.
</p>

<p>
This SRFI describes a specific P<small>OSIX</small> API for Scheme.
Rather than attempting to compromise between existing implementations,
the scsh system call specification was chosen as a base document.
Consequently, this SRFI is a reduced version of
<a href="https://scsh.net/docu/html/man-Z-H-4.html#node_chap_3">Chapter 3, "System Calls"</a>
of version 0.6.7 of the <i>Scsh Reference Manual</i>.
The numbered headers are aligned with those used in the Reference Manual.
</p>
<p>Scsh 0.6.7 was chosen for two main reasons.  It is fairly old, so most of its operations,
even those which were non-Posix at the time (2006) are now included in Posix, and it has
few or no operations that aren't Posix at all.  In addition, it is politically fairly neutral,
being tied to an obsolete version of Scheme 48, which is not being actively developed.
Scsh 0.7 exists (see Implementation section), but was
not used in designing this SRFI because it is incompletely documented.
</p>
<p>
This SRFI makes no effort to provide all 81 headers, 1191 interfaces, and 51
data types of full P<small>OSIX</small>.  Instead it provides access to a reasonable number of
highly portable interfaces (many of them even available on Windows)
with wrappers to make them more Scheme-like.
In particular, this SRFI excludes:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most operations on file descriptors
  other than converting between them and Scheme ports.
</p></li><li><p>
Everything to do with the creation and management of subprocesses and
communication with them.  The low-level P<small>OSIX</small> operations
are tricky to use, and a future SRFI will provide a higher-level interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Networking operations: see
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-106/srfi-106.html">SRFI 106</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Date and time operations, as the
P<small>OSIX</small> date and time operations are irregular and awkward.
This SRFI provides only the current time.
</p></li><li><p>
Access to command-line arguments and environment variables, as well
as provisions for exiting a process, as they are already provided by R7RS-small.
</p></li><li><p>
P<small>OSIX</small> file locking, which is notoriously
<a href="http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/locking.html">broken as designed</a>.
Consider the use of dot files (or if necessary
non-portable facilities) instead.
</p></li><li><p>
All provisions for signal handling, as they are complex and require deep
integration with the particular Scheme implementation.
</p></li><li><p>
Memory-mapped I/O, locales, syslog, System V message
queues, and pseudo-TTYs, as they are considered specialized and out of scope.
Future SRFIs may provide interfaces for them.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The use of colons to join record names and fields into the name of a
record accessor is a convention of Scheme 48, on which scsh is built.
</p>

<p>Note: This SRFI is already very long, and adding detailed examples would
make it even longer.  However,
<a href="https://github.com/scheme-requests-for-implementation/srfi-170/blob/master/srfi/chibi-scheme/lib/srfi/170/test.sld">the Chibi test suite</a>
is a good source of usage examples.</p>

<h2>Specification</h2>

<p>
Implementations of this SRFI on non-P<small>OSIX</small> systems, especially Windows,
must provide all the procedure names and syntax keywords.
However, if the specified action is not possible, the procedure should
either take no action and return some reasonable default value,
or raise an exception.
</p>
<p>A Scheme implementation that supports both this SRFI and multiple
threads of control must ensure that when a thread invokes a blocking I/O
procedure defined below, only that thread is blocked and not any other
concurrently running ones.
Because Scheme threads may be multiplexed on top of P<small>OSIX</small>
threads, the per-thread P<small>OSIX</small> functions may not do the
right thing.
</p>

<h3>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Error handling</h3>
<p>
The procedures of this SRFI signal an exception
when the underlying system calls fail.  This is fully documented in
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-198/srfi-198.html">SRFI 198</a>,
which may not yet be finalized when you are reading this.
However, the <code>foreign-status?</code> predicate from that SRFI
will detect the condition objects raised by the procedures
of this SRFI.
</p>

<h3 id="node_sec_3.2">3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;I/O</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Dealing with P<small>OSIX</small> file descriptors in a Scheme environment is difficult.
In P<small>OSIX</small>, open files are part of the process environment, and are referenced
by small exact integers called <i>file descriptors</i>. Open file descriptors are
the fundamental way I/O redirections are passed to subprocesses and executed
programs, since file descriptors are preserved across <code>fork</code> and
<code>exec</code> operations.</p>
<p>
Scheme, on the other hand, uses ports for specifying I/O sources and sinks.
Ports are garbage-collected Scheme objects, not integers.
When a port is garbage collected, it is effectively closed,
but whether the underlying file descriptor is closed is left as an implementation detail.
Because file
descriptors are just integers, it's impossible to garbage collect them &mdash; you
wouldn't be able to close file descriptor 3 unless there were no 3's in the
system, and you could further prove that your program would never again
compute a 3. This is difficult at best.</p>
<p>
If a Scheme program only used Scheme ports, and never actually used
file descriptors, this would not be a problem. But Scheme code
needs to descend to the file descriptor level in at least two circumstances:
when interfacing to foreign code, and
when interfacing to a subprocess.
</p><p>
This causes a problem. Suppose we have a Scheme port constructed
on top of file descriptor 3. We intend to execute a successor program that
will expect this file descriptor. If we drop references to the port,
the garbage collector may prematurely close file 3 before we fork
the subprocess.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, there is no even vaguely portable solution to this problem.
Scsh and Guile undertake heroic measures to
open new file descriptors for ports when the old file descriptors are
repurposed for something else, and to track when closing a port implies
closing its file descriptor or not.
But doing so involves more
changes than an implementation should have to make in order
to provide this SRFI.</p>

<p>Consequently, this SRFI assumes that file descriptors will only
be used at the edges of the program, and that most I/O operations will be
performed on ports.
As an exception, <code>open-file</code> is provided, because
it allows arguments that the Scheme standard does not.  It returns
a file descriptor that can then be converted to a port.
</p>
<p>
<div><code>(open-file <i>fname flags [permission-bits]</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>fd</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>open()</code>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>
<i>Permission-bits</i> defaults to <code>#o666</code>, but are masked by the current umask.
<i>Flags</i> is an integer bitmask, composed by adding together
one or more of the following constants:
<code>open/read</code>,
<code>open/write</code>,
<code>open/read+write</code>,
<code>open/append</code>,
<code>open/create</code>,
<code>open/exclusive</code>,
<code>open/nofollow</code>,
<code>open/truncate</code>.
<p>It is an error unless exactly one of the <code>open/read</code>, <code>open/write</code>, or
<code>open/read+write</code> flags is provided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following routines allow conversion between ports and file
descriptors.</p>
<div><code>(fdes->textual-input-port <i>fd</i> [<i>buffer-mode</i>])</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>port</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;</div>

<div><code>(fdes->binary-output-port <i>fd</i> [<i>buffer-mode</i>])</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>port</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>
<p>These procedures wrap a newly created port around the specified file descriptor,
effectively importing it into the Scheme world.
In particular, the textual ports use the same character encoding applied
by default in the underlying implementation.</p>
<p>The <i>buffer-mode</i> argument, if present, is one of the symbols <code>none</code>,
  <code>block</code> (the default), or <code>line</code>.
  When <i>buffer-mode</i> is <code>none</code>,
  bytes are intended to appear from the source or at the destination as soon as possible;
  otherwise, bytes may be accumulated and transmitted as a block.
  When <i>buffer-mode</i> is <code>block</code>, bytes are intended
  to be transmitted as a fixed size block when a buffer is filled.
  When <i>buffer-mode</i> is <code>line</code>, bytes are intended
  to be transmitted as a block when a newline byte <code>#xA</code> is encountered.

if the implementation permits them.

<h3>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;File system</h3>

computer's file system.

<div><code>(read-symlink <i>fname</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>string</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P<small>OSIX</small> <code>readlink()</code>&nbsp;</div>

</p>
<blockquote><i>Remark: </i>
There is an unfortunate atomicity problem with the <code>rename-file</code>
procedure: if you create file <code>new-fname</code> sometime between
<code>rename-file</code>'s existence check and the actual rename operation,
your file will be clobbered with <code>old-fname</code>. There is no way to
prevent this problem; at least it is highly unlikely to occur in practice.

<blockquote>
These procedures are file-type predicates that test the
file type stored in <i>file-info</i>.
<p>
This SRFI does not provide a special means for checking the
permission bits in a <code>file-info</code> record,
though they are available in <code>file-info:mode</code>.
There are several problems with such procedures.
First, there's an
atomicity issue. In between checking permissions for a file and then trying
an operation on the file, another process could change the permissions,
so a return value from these functions guarantees nothing. Second,
Posix special-cases permission checking when the uid is 0 (<code>root</code>)
&mdash; if the file exists, root is assumed to have the requested permission.
However, not even root can write a file stored on a read-only file system,
such as a CD-ROM.</p>

The <i>dotfiles?</i> flag (default <code>#f</code>) causes dot files to be
included in the list.
Regardless of the value of <i>dotfiles?</i>, the two files <code>.</code> and
<code>..</code> are <i>never</i> returned.<p>
The directory <i>dir</i> is not prepended to each filename in the

<blockquote><code>(directory-files "/etc")</code></blockquote>returns
<blockquote><code>("chown" "exports" "fstab" <code>...</code>)</code></blockquote><i>not</i>

prepend the directory,

<div><code>(make-directory-files-generator <i>dir [dotfiles?]</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>generator</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;</div>

<p>Like <code>directory-files</code> above, the directory <i>dir</i>

<p>The generator approach is particularly useful when the number of

The <code>open-directory</code> procedure opens the

Then <code>read-directory</code>

The <code><i>dot-files?</i></code> argument controls whether filenames beginning with &quot;<code>.</code>&quot; are returned.

<div><code>temp-file-prefix</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>string parameter</i>&nbsp;</div>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
A SRFI 39 or R7RS parameter that returns a string when invoked.  Its initial value is
the value of the environment variable <code>TMPDIR</code> concatenated with <code>"/<i>pid</i>"</code>
if <code>TMPDIR</code> is set and to
<code>"/tmp/<i>pid</i>"</code> otherwise, where <i>pid</i> is the id of the current process.
</blockquote>
<div><code>(create-temp-file <i>[prefix]</i>)</code> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><i>string</i></i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>Creates a new temporary file and returns its name.
The optional argument specifies the filename prefix to use, and defaults
to the result of invoking <code>temp-file-prefix</code>.
The procedure generates a sequence of filenames that have <i>prefix</i> as
a common prefix, looking for a filename that doesn't already exist in the
file system. When it finds one, it creates it with permission <code>#o600</code>
and returns the filename. (The file permission can be changed to a more
permissive permission with <code>set-file-mode</code> after being created.)<p>
This file is guaranteed to be brand new. No other process will have it
open. This procedure does not simply return a filename that is very
likely to be unused. It returns a filename that definitely did not exist
at the moment <code>create-temp-file</code> created it.</p>
<p>
It is not necessary for the process's pid to be a part of the filename
for the uniqueness guarantees to hold. The pid component of the default
prefix simply serves to scatter the name searches into sparse regions, so
that collisions are less likely to occur. This speeds things up, but does
not affect correctness.</p>

<blockquote>
This procedure can be used to perform certain atomic transactions on
the file system involving filenames. Some examples:
<ul>
<li>Linking a file to a fresh backup temp name.
</li><li>Creating and opening an unused, secure temp file.
</li><li>Creating an unused temporary directory.
</li></ul><p></p>
<p>
This procedure uses <i>prefix</i> to generate a series of trial
filenames.  <i>Prefix</i> is a string, and
defaults to the value of invoking <code>temp-file-prefix</code>.
File names are generated by
concatenating <i>prefix</i>
with a varying string.<p>
The <i>maker</i> procedure is called serially on each filename
generated.  It must return at least one value; it may return multiple
values. If the first return value is <code>#f</code> or if <i>maker</i> raises an
exception indicating that the file exists
<code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> will loop,
generating a new filename and calling <i>maker</i> again. If the first
return value is true, the loop is terminated, returning whatever value(s)
<i>maker</i> returned.</p>
<p>
After a number of unsuccessful trials, <code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> may give up
and signal an error.</p>
<p>
To rename a file to a temporary name:
</p>
<blockquote><code>
(call-with-temporary-filename&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(backup)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(create-hard-link&nbsp;old-file&nbsp;backup)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backup)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;".temp.")&nbsp;;&nbsp;Keep&nbsp;link&nbsp;in&nbsp;current working directory.<br>
(delete-file&nbsp;old-file)</code></blockquote>
Recall that this SRFI reports procedure failure by raising an error
exception, not by returning an error code. This is critical for
this example &mdash; the programmer can assume that if the
<code>call-with-temporary-filename</code> call returns, it returns successfully.
So the following <code>delete-file</code> call can be reliably invoked,
safe in the knowledge that the backup link has definitely been established.<p>
To create a unique temporary directory:
</p>
<blockquote><code>
(call-with-temporary-filename&nbsp;(lambda&nbsp;(dir)&nbsp;(create-directory&nbsp;dir)&nbsp;dir)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"/tmp/tempdir.")</code></blockquote>
Similar operations can be used to generate unique fifos,
or to return values other than the new filename (for example, an open port).

<h3>3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;Environment variables</h3>
<p>R<sup>7</sup>RS provides two procedures (via SRFI 98) to get
environment variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>(get-environment-variables)</code></li>
<li><code>(get-environment-variable <i>name</i>)</code></li>
</ul>
<p> Setters have not yet been standardized, so this SRFI provides
them:</p>

<div><code>(set-environment-variable! <i>name</i> <i>value</i>)</code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>undefined</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)</div>
<blockquote>
Change the value of the environment variable <i>name</i> to
be <i>value</i>. Both <i>name</i> and <i>value</i> are strings.
If <i>name</i> is not defined at the time of call, a new variable is
added; if <i>name</i> is defined, its old value is discarded and
replaced by <i>value</i>. If <i>name</i> or <i>value</i> are invalid
according to the operating system, an exception is raised.
Mutating <i>name</i> or <i>value</i> after the call must not change
the name or value of the environment variable.
</blockquote>

<div><code>(delete-environment-variable! <i>name</i>)</code>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rarr; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>undefined</i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(procedure)</div>
<blockquote>
Remove the environment variable <i>name</i> such that a
subsequent <code>(get-environment-variable <i>name</i>)</code> would
return <code>#f</code>. If the variable cannot be removed, an
exception is raised. If <i>name</i> does not currently have a value,
the call silently succeeds.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Concurrency note:</b> Under most operating systems, environment
variables are per-process, not per-thread. Multi-threaded
implementations should guard against race conditions.</p>

<p><b>Naming note:</b> Many Scheme implementations (including scsh)
use the short procedure names <code>getenv</code>
and <code>setenv</code> (or minor variations). Since the long
name <code>get-environment-variable</code> has been canonized by
R<sup>n</sup>RS and SRFI 98, this SRFI matches it instead. Since
environment variables are OS variables rather than Scheme variables,
it's debatable whether procedures to modify them should bear
the <code>!</code> suffix. MIT Scheme has the suffixed names and we
are not aware of any Scheme implementation with the unsuffixed names,
so the suffix is kept in this SRFI.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/scheme/scsh">which can be found at GitHub in the scsh repository of scheme</a>,
and a Chibi Scheme <code>(srfi 170)</code> library.  You can find the Chibi Scheme example implementation,

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Thanks to Olin Shivers, <i>sine quo non</i>, and all the Scheme implementors
who have followed his work.  Thanks also to all the participants in the
SRFI mailing list.</p>

<p>(Why <i>quo</i>?  Because in <i>sine qua non</i>
the pronoun is feminine, agreeing with <i>re</i> 'thing' understood,
whereas Olin is masculine.)</p>
